            Alrighty then. I'll ask a series of questions, and you merely need
            to answer them with "yes" or "no".
            <br/>
            Do you enjoy writing programs in your freetime?

                Wow. Well you better consider another career path
                because it sounds like you're in the wrong place... just kidding!
                <br/>
                <br/>
                I'm only programmed with info regarding a very small subset
                of all CS jobs - just five to be exact! You should search a
                job board such as O*NET online for other jobs in CS that might
                suit you and your preferences. CS is an extremely broad field
                with something for everyone, so don't be discouraged if your
                dream job isn't readily apparent at first. Best of luck!
